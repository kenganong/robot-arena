Special Rules (for special people)

1. Do not share memory
  Your robots are individuals and prefer to be treated as such. Do not write to memory in a place from which other
  robots, even of the same type, read. Just use your personal memory dict.
2. Do not raise exceptions
  If a robot raises an exception when asked for a move, that robot will be considered to overheat, taking 1 damage.
3. Do not actually overheat
  Infinite loops, unbounded memory, or other such issues will cause the game manager to retroactively erase the
  existence of offending robot types. Your robots are not Fixed Points and history will forget them.
4. Do not break the fourth wall
  Python is a hackable language, but please do not attempt have your robots discover more knowledge about the arena
  or life outside than the API provides. Doing so would admit to being a machine and therefore against robot protocol.
5. Write simply
  Once your robot easily trashes all the others in the arena, the other contestants will be more amazed to find your
  code elegant and simple than a complex beast they could never hope to understand.
  There are many dangers and twists to the arena and it may be best to ignore some, moving with simple purpose. Feel
  free to write concise strategies that may not have a chance to win.
6. You may show discernment
  When a robot examines their surroundings in the arena, they are able to see the names of other robots nearby. It is
  acceptable to act differently to different robots such as attempting not to shoot robots with the particular names.
  It is also acceptable to have one robot's purpose be to help a particular other robot to victory.
